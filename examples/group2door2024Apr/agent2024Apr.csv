QuickStart: 
Step1: Please select csv file to read in simulation data and compartement geometry data!
Step2: Create simulation object!
Step3: Compute and visualize simulation!

When simulation starts, please try to press the following keys in your keybroad, and you will see the effects on the screen. 
Press <pageup/pagedown> to zoom in or zoom out.
Press arrow keys to move the entities vertically or horizonally in screen.
Press 1/2/3 in number panel (Right side in the keyboard) to display the door or exit data on the screen.
Press <o> and <p> to show the egress flow field. 
Press <space> to pause or resume the simulaton.
